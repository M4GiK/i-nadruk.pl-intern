<p><img src="LOKALIZACJA OBRAZKA" style="width: 369px;">&nbsp;DTF (Direct to Film) is a printing technique that allows designs to be directly applied to a variety of materials, such as fabric, wood or glass. Unlike traditional methods, DTF uses a thermal transfer film that transfers graphics to the surface using a heated roller or press. This method provides vibrant colors and high print quality, ideal for both advertising and artistic purposes. When used correctly, DTF can be an effective tool in creating personalized products and unique designs.<br>
